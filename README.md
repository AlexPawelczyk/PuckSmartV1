# PuckSmartV1
CS 889 - Information Visualization - Final Project

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
PuckSmart is a Web interface for visualizing spatiotemporal data and analytics of ice hockey games. PuckSmart converts spatiotemporal game data and analytics into meaningful visualizations of information, and the initial prototype features two different views of data. The shot map (index.html) provides a visual summary of the key events of a hockey game, while the simulation view (playground.html) presents a novel spatiotemporal design for simulating games and dynamically visualizing their key events and analytics metrics.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR LAUNCHING PUCKSMART
1) Download and install Node.js (if not already done so)
2) Clone this repository
3) Via git bash (or terminal, command prompt, etc.), navigate to the PuckSmartV1 directory
4) Enter this command to launch a local HTTP server: node server.js
5) Navigate to chrome and enter the following url: http://localhost:8080/index.html
6) You're done! The PuckSmart shotmap view should be up and running.
   - To navigate to the simulation view, enter this url: http://localhost:8080/playground.html
   
NOTE ABOUT THE SMALL NUMBER OF COMMITS:
Initial prototypes were developed on my local machine, and I only decided to push my project to Git after I submmitted my final project for marking.
